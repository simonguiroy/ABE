# ABE - Activation-Based Early-Stopping

This repository includes code accompagnying our paper **Improving Meta-Learning Generalization with Activation-Based Early-Stopping** [(see link)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P4rCj0swQiRwoLOOGPsuYKKse88t7XpM/view?usp=sharing), accepted at [CoLLAs 2022](https://lifelong-ml.cc/) and to be published in the [Proceedings of Machine Learning Research](https://proceedings.mlr.press/) (PMLR).

In this repo you will find :
- Code for computing the activation trajectory performing early-stopping
- Notebook : TensorFlow example for how to apply the method.
- Notebook : PyTorch example for how to apply the method.
